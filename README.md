# Dodger (The Game)
This serves as my Final Project for the ECE241 Course at the University of Toronto.

Introducing Dodger, a meticulously crafted, fully animated game developed entirely from scratch using Verilog. It embodies a retro-style platformer game where players navigate by dodging randomly falling objects, controlled with the left and right arrow keys. Successfully dodging objects earns players a point, and the game concludes upon collision. As time progresses, the game's difficulty intensifies, with objects falling at increasingly faster rates. The high score is then securely stored.


## Key Features of the Game:

- Player control facilitated through PS2 keyboard input
- Immersive sound effects delivered through speakers
- Real-time display of the player's current score on a HEX display, along with the all-time high score
- Efficient utilization of SDRAM Memory to store and retrieve Title Screens, High Scores, Audio Files, etc.

## Here's a short clip of the game:
